The goal of this interactive scenario is to deploy a Docker Container running an HTTP web server to an OpenShift cluster.

Using the User Interface (UI), the scenario will help you understand how to deploy a new application, scale and load balance traffic before deploying an update version of the application.

OpenShift is an open source PaaS by Red Hat based on top of Docker containers and the Kubernetes container cluster manager for enterprise app development.
